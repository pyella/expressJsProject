expressJsProject

Used MongoDb as backend and created a Rest API using nodeJs and expressJs.

Used Gulp as task runner.

Running instructions:

Get the mongoDb installed on your machine,
To start mongoDB you need to navigate to mongoDb bin folder and run mongod command.

Once you have mongoDB running, Install node packages (using npm install)
which are dependent to get expressJs and other node moduels

Type gulp, You should be good to go from port 8000 (Can always change this from gulpfile.js).

Testing framework used: gulp-mocha.

Advice: I used postman to test my application.
